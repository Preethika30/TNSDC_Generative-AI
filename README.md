## Getting started

### Prerequisites
This project is written in Python 3.6.6 using Tensorflow (deep learning), NumPy (numerical computing), Pillow (image processing), OpenCV (computer vision) and seaborn (visualization) packages.


### Downloading official pretrained weights
Let's download official weights pretrained on COCO dataset.
